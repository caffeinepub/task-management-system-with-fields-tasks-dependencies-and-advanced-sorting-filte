  "summary": "Implemented robust hex validation and fallback in soft tint utilities, and updated FieldCard to resolve stored field colors via getColorValue before computing soft tints. This likely prevents the \"Invalid hex color: teal\" crash, but the diff does not clearly show FieldCard explicitly falling back to the app default color when the stored field.color is non-hex (it appears to convert color IDs like \"teal\" to a hex value instead).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Ensure FieldCard falls back to the app default color when the stored field color is not a hex value (instead of using the non-hex value) for card tinting and related styling.",
      "reason": "FieldCard now resolves field.color via getColorValue(field.color), with an inline comment indicating it converts IDs like \"teal\" to a hex value like \"#14B8A6\". The diff does not show explicit logic in FieldCard to detect non-hex stored values and replace them with the app default color; it appears to map non-hex IDs to specific hex colors rather than defaulting. (It’s possible getColorValue applies a default internally, but that implementation is not included in the diff summary, so this requirement cannot be confirmed as implemented.)",
