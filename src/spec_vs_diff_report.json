  "summary": "Diff appears to move the field tag into TaskCard via a new optional prop and tighten spacing for a more compact All Tasks list, but files are truncated so removal of the external badge cannot be fully verified. Diff also adds an undo toast on completion, which was not requested.",

    {
      "description": "Add a 5-second undo toast/action when completing a task (and mutate with `silent: true` to suppress default toast).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked to move the field tag and reduce spacing; it explicitly says not to change task functionality. Adding an undo flow/toast changes completion behavior/UX.",
