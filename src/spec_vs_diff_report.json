  "summary": "The diff shows a global CSS effort toward fixing modal transparency via Radix selectors in `frontend/src/index.css`, but there are no concrete code changes shown that restore Heroicons usage/rendering across the app. Additionally, the diff introduces/updates documentation-like summaries describing many unrelated frontend enhancements that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Restore Heroicons as the app’s predefined icon set and ensure icons render correctly across the project, including field icon rendering and icons shown inside dialogs/alerts/buttons.",
      "reason": "Only `frontend/src/index.css`, `frontend-file-summaries.txt`, and `project_state.json` were modified. The provided diff content contains no actual implementation changes for icon presets, Heroicons imports/mapping, or dynamic icon resolution—only narrative descriptions in `frontend-file-summaries.txt`.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Broad frontend behavior changes (boot orchestration, retry logic, logout from error screen, stage-aware boot error handling, recovery flow for stopped-canister scenarios).",
      "reason": "These changes are described in `frontend-file-summaries.txt` but are not part of the BuildRequest’s scope (only modal opacity + Heroicons restoration). The diff evidence provided shows only summary/documentation updates rather than requested feature-focused implementation.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "New/expanded UI features unrelated to the request (e.g., field backgroundColor handling, new pickers for 20 background colors / 100 icons, task list enhancements, duration badges, field tag rendering, import/export guard changes).",
      "reason": "These are not requested (non-goals: no new product features beyond fixing modal opacity and restoring Heroicons), yet they are described as implemented in `frontend-file-summaries.txt`.",
